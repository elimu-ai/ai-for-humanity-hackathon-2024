**Why Soga?**

- Soga addresses the need for elevating education globally. Currently, [10%](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/250-million-children-out-school-what-you-need-know-about-unescos-latest-education-data) of children worldwide are not in school. And there simply aren't enough teachers available for these 64 million children, so creating an AI chat application can help ensure a world of equal opportunities.
