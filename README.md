**Why Soga?**
- Soga addresses the need for elevating education globally. Currently, [10%](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/250-million-children-out-school-what-you-need-know-about-unescos-latest-education-data) of children worldwide are not in school. And there simply aren't enough teachers, so creating an AI chat application can help alleviate this need.
