## Submission Details

**Project name**

- Soga

**Project tagline**

- LLM chat application for out-of-school children

**Introduction**

- Mobile devices are soon getting powerful enough to run entire LLMs locally, and we can take advantage of that to make basic education more widely accessible.

**Key Features**

– App that can run on any Android device (phone, tablet, etc)
- AI tutor that helps students learn basic math concepts (e.g. addition and subtraction)
- Conversational chat format

**Why Soga?**

- Soga addresses the need for elevating education globally. Currently, [10%](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/250-million-children-out-school-what-you-need-know-about-unescos-latest-education-data) of children worldwide are not in school. And there simply aren't enough teachers available for these 64 million children, so creating an AI chat application can help ensure a world of equal opportunities.
